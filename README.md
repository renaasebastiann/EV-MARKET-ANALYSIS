EV MARKET SIZE ANALYSIS

1. Define whether the analysis is global, regional, or focused on specific countries.

2. Gather information from industry associations, market research firms (e.g., BloombergNEF, IEA), and government publications relevant to the EV market.

3. Use historical data to identify trends in EV sales, production, and market.

4. Analyze the market size and growth rates for different EV segments.

5. Based on the market size analysis, provide strategic recommendations for businesses looking to enter or expand in the EV market.

--For the task of market size of electric vehicles analysis, we can explore the following areas:

---EV Adoption Over Time: Analyze the growth of the EV population by model year.
---Geographical Distribution: Understand where EVs are most commonly registered (e.g., by country or city).
---EV Types: Breakdown of the dataset by electric vehicle type (BEV, etc.).
---Make and Model Popularity: Identify the most popular makes and models among the registered EVs.
---Electric Range Analysis: Analyze the electric range of vehicles to see how EV technology is progressing.
---Estimated Growth in Market Size: Analyze and find the estimated growth in the market size of electric vehicles.

NOTES:
Summary of EV registrations for recent years:

In 2021, there were 19,063 EVs registered.
In 2022, the number increased to 27708 EVs.
In 2023, a significant jump to 57,519 EVs was observed.
For 2024, currently, 7,072 EVs are registered, which suggests partial data.

In the graph showing the progression of the average electric range of vehicles from around the year 2000 to 2024:

There is a general upward trend in the average electric range of EVs over the years, indicating improvements in technology and battery efficiency.
There is a noticeable peak around the year 2020 when the average range reaches its highest point.
Following 2020, thereâ€™s a significant drop in the average range, which could indicate that data for the following years might be incomplete or reflect the introduction of several lower-range models.
After the sharp decline, there is a slight recovery in the average range in the most recent year shown on the graph.


RESULT:
The number of actual EV registrations remained relatively low and stable until around 2010, after which there was a consistent and steep upward trend, suggesting a significant increase in EV adoption.
The forecasted EV registrations predict an even more dramatic increase in the near future, with the number of registrations expected to rise sharply in the coming years.
